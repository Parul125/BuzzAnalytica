# About‚ùì
<ul>
<li>Through this project  I have created a basic structure of social media database which could easily be connected to frontend interface.  </li>
<li>Here I am  managing the data of multiple users, their followers  , interests and public activity on the social media platform which includes postlikes ,comments , commentlikes , hashtag followed ,bookmarks and many more... </li>
<li>Through our SQL query we have shown a clear cut description of connection and inter relation between different activities on social media. </li>
<li>Here I have  tried to fetch and store the  data in its true storage form into this database like (img/videos in url) </li>
<li>With my true efforts and research  I have tried to give a simple and more exact view of a basic social interconnecting site.</li>
</ul>
